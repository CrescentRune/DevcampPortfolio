### Background
A long time ago a boy had a dream to build computer programs. He worked hard and ended up in a computer science degree at Purdue University. It turns out they don't teach a lot of more hands-on application development, and the boy hates doing tutorials, so he started doing online classes from code camps to widen his skill set.

### How Quaint
This is part of my ongoing efforts in bettering myself and my webdev skills, as that is my current field of professional programming experience. If you, like me, despise youtube and text tutorials and their ever-deepening outdatedness, try some online classes! The big companies throw discounts at you frequently, and putting a little money goes a long way to staying motivated!
This particular project is Part 1 of DevCamp's rails 5 course, which I recommend for beginners and intermediate skilled programmers. Except of course that it recommends using rvm instead of rbenv, and I cannot express how painful my history with rvm is, and I will not be going there again.
